# Automatic-Watering-System
This project presents the use of soil humidity sensors which will help in checking and keeping records about the changes in soil humidity. 
It involves automated checking of humidity, moisture, water level and temperature of the land.
Automatic irrigation installation is handed for irrigation whenever demanded. 
The smart irrigation system is made up of different detectors for keeping a check on ecological conditions and transferring the data to the farmers on the developed mobile operation through Wi- Fi module.
This system can be used indeed in small scale sundeck gardening. The system is precisely stationed in such a way so that it can be user friendly and doable to everyone. 
This project will work in hybrid mode i.e. solar energy as well as electrical energy. In this project we will try to overcome one of the downsides of the existing smart irrigation systems i.e. weather forecasting.
